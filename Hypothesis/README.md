This repository contains the hypothesis and theories relevant to this experiment. To secure a uniform understanding for all readers, a number of papers of the expositions of the theories are included with minimal assumption of previous chemistry knowledge besides the basics understanding of physics. They may serve as reference materials, which when necessary, may be cited.

The hypothesis derived from the theories are contained in one document under the name hypothesis. The specific experiments conducted to justify them are referred to and a reasonable explanation is provided. The experiments are referred as well as later justifications for some hypothesis. A manner as concise as can be strived would be adopted.

The papers and documents are all written in latex, with their editable links included in each file in this repository.

The sequence of adviced reading may be An Illustration of the Ideal Gas Law, the Principal Unit, Corollaries of the Collision Model, Reaction Mechanisms, and Chemical Equilibrium.
